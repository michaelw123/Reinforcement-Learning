# Reinforcement Learning
This is a research project that explores Reinforcement Learning by solving some of the RL problems with various approaches using Scala, with focus on policy/value systems. We intend to research by generalizing the RL problems. We choose Scala for its implementation, to explore the power of the hybrid of FP and imperative paradigm and address the complexity of environment/agent in RL.

Given the prolific python implementations to various DL and RL frameworks and algorithms, our research objective is to increase the presence of scala language, and provide an alternative framework and library to this research field; meanwhile, we hope our research may yeild a level of abstraction to the agent/environment problems in RL, and provide guidelines to future researches.

We plan to follow Sutton & Barto's book Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition), and expand our research into more specific algorithms.


Some of the planned topics are:

  [* Multi-Armed Bandit problem](MultiArmBandit.md)

* Dynamic Programming 
* Markov Decision Processes
* Monte Carlo Methods
* Temporal-Difference Learning
* Q-Learning
