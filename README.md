# Reinforcement Learning
This is a research project that explores Reinforcement Learning by solving some of the RL problems with various approaches using Scala, with focus on policy/value systems. We intend to generalize the RL problems into a framework. We choose Scala for its implementation, as we believe that the hybrid of FP and imperative paradigm is best suited to address the complexity of environment/agent in RL.

Some of the planned topics are:
* Multi-Armed Bandit problem
* Dynamic Programming 
* Markov Decision Processes
* Monte Carlo Methods
* Temporal-Difference Learning
